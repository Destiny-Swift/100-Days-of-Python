The completion of this task introduced me to useful applications of python.
This is the start of something damn great; to great and awesome!

letter has to be opened in each iteration to keep [name] constant
Or it can be opened once and a variable equated to it with each iteration of the names. (Angela's Method)
For strings, changes made to this copy variable won't affect the parent variable.
It's a different case for lists, unless you use the .copy() method.
And doc worked for MS Word extension and not docx. Hmm ðŸ¤¨
